/******************************************************************************
* FILE: condvar.c
* DESCRIPTION:
*   Example code for using Pthreads condition variables.  The main thread
*   creates three threads.  Two of those threads increment a "count" variable,
*   while the third thread watches the value of "count".  When "count" 
*   reaches a predefined limit, the waiting thread is signaled by one of the
*   incrementing threads. The waiting thread "awakens" and then modifies
*   count. The program continues until the incrementing threads reach
*   TCOUNT. The main program prints the final value of count.
* SOURCE: Adapted from example code in "Pthreads Programming", B. Nichols
*   et al. O'Reilly and Associates. 
* LAST REVISED: 10/14/10  Blaise Barney
